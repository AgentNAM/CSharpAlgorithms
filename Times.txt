Binary Search:

  6 elements -> 00:00:00.0003850 ms
  8 elements -> 00:00:00.0002648 ms
  10 elements -> 00:00:00.0002392 ms
  12 elements -> 00:00:00.0002590 ms
  14 elements -> 00:00:00.0002725 ms

The times of execution for the binary search algorithm do not seem to follow a particular pattern.
I suspect that this variation is at least partially influenced by external factors, such as the time between trials.


Linear Search:

  6 elements -> 00:00:00.0000876 ms
  8 elements -> 00:00:00.0000865 ms
  10 elements -> 00:00:00.0000802 ms
  12 elements -> 00:00:00.0000860 ms
  14 elements -> 00:00:00.0000803 ms

The times of execution for the linear search algorithm do not seem to follow a particular pattern.
I suspect that this variation is at least partially influenced by external factors, such as the time between trials.


Bubble Sort:

  6 elements -> 00:00:00.0001110 ms
  8 elements -> 00:00:00.0001224 ms
  10 elements -> 00:00:00.0001335 ms
  12 elements -> 00:00:00.0002052 ms
  14 elements -> 00:00:00.0001165 ms

The times of execution for the bubble sort algorithm seem to increase for the first four trials, but then suddenly decreases in the fifth trial.
The first four trials were conducted in quick succession, but the fifth trial was conducted several minutes after the fourth, as I had just then realized that I was supposed to have at least five trials.
I suspect that this sudden drop in execution time was caused by the increased time between trials.


The binary search and linear search algorithms are both search algorithms, meaning that they return the position of a target value in a sorted array.
Meanwhile, the bubble sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm, meaning that it takes an unsorted array and puts them in order.



Selection Sort:

  6 elements -> 00:00:00.0001406 ms
  8 elements -> 00:00:00.0001249 ms
  10 elements -> 00:00:00.0001578 ms
  12 elements -> 00:00:00.0001283 ms
  14 elements -> 00:00:00.0001279 ms

The times of execution for the selection sort algorithm do not seem to follow a particular pattern.
I suspect that this variation is at least partially influenced by external factors, such as the time between trials.


Quick Sort:

  6 elements -> 00:00:00.0002301 ms
  8 elements -> 00:00:00.0004479 ms
  10 elements -> 00:00:00.0002269 ms
  12 elements -> 00:00:00.0002274 ms
  14 elements -> 00:00:00.0002288 ms

The times of execution for the quick sort algorithm do not seem to follow a particular pattern.
I suspect that this variation is at least partially influenced by external factors, such as the time between trials.


The bubble sort and selection sort algorithms do not use recursion. Meanwhile, the quick sort algorithm does use recursion.



Merge Sort:

  6 elements -> 00:00:00.0003133 ms
  8 elements -> 00:00:00.0003149 ms
  10 elements -> 00:00:00.0003551 ms
  12 elements -> 00:00:00.0003161 ms
  14 elements -> 00:00:00.0003176 ms

The times of execution for the merge sort algorithm do not seem to follow a particular pattern.
I suspect that this variation is at least partially influenced by external factors, such as the time between trials.
